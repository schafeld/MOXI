# MOXI – Work in Progress

Mutation Observer eXperience Injector – Library for frontend A/B-testing and personalisation of reactive SPA user interfaces.

## ⚠️ Warning

This library is still in development and not ready for production use.

When ready it will require a lot of caution and testing to use it in production.

When using mutation observers, you should always be careful to not introduce performance issues. Also you run the risk of breaking your application when you are not careful (infinity loops if you inject UI changes into the observed area).
